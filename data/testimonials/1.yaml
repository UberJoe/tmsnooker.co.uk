text: "Started Snooker from scratch with Tony as coach and within two lessons, Tony had already taught me the basics and I felt a lot more confident very quickly. He often arranges to play some frames with some of his other coachees, and he'll give some tips and always let you know what you're doing wrong. Truly knows what he's doing and couldn't recommend him enough."
