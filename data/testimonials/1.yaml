text: "Following a lengthy break from snooker, I took up coaching with Tony to revitalise my enthusiasm for a game I’ve loved since a boy. Being a middle-aged fella, taking to being taught again at such an age can be intimidating, but Tony is very considered and skillful at making you feel at ease - and he is as quick to highlight the things you do well as he is to guide on those areas that need attention. I find Tony a pleasure to work with and I’m enjoying my new found love for the game."
